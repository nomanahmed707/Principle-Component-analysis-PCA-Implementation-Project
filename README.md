# ðŸ§  PCA Project Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction on Handwritten Digit Data

This project demonstrates the practical application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the famous MNIST digit recognition dataset to reduce dimensionality, visualize the data, and improve classification performance.


# ðŸš€ Project Highlights
Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits dataset (train.csv from Kaggle)

Objective: Use PCA to reduce feature space for visualization and classification

# Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing and normalization

Dimensionality reduction using sklearn.decomposition.PCA

2D visualization of PCA-transformed data

Classifier training with:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machines

Performance evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

# ðŸ“Š Outcome
The Repo showcases how PCA helps visualize high-dimensional data and improves or maintains classification performance by removing redundancy in features.
